- better plot, using batche(s) data (every 30 batches)
so the x-axis must have num batch and num epoch. 
just plotting at point of epoch can be misleading. 


- make loading models into a funciton (and maybe put it in utils.py), instead of just hanging out there


- implement text generation on evaluation.
